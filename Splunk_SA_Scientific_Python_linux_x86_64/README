Splunk_SA_Scientific_Python - Python for Scientific Computing in Splunk

*** Powered by Anaconda! See http://continuum.io/ ***

This package contains a Python interpreter bundled with the following
Python scientific and machine learning libraries:

  * numpy 1.10.4
  * scipy 0.17.0
  * pandas 0.17.1
  * scikit-learn 0.17.0

Splunk_SA_Scientific_Python is cross-platform and available for 64-bit
Linux, 32-bit Linux, Darwin, and 64-bit Windows.

The included exec_anaconda() function can be used to execute Splunk
Custom Search Commands and REST handlers within the bundled Anaconda
interpreter, thereby enabling you to import modules like numpy in a
robust, cross-platform manner.

To use Splunk_SA_Scientific_Python, copy exec_anaconda.py into your
app's bin directory. At the top of your custom search command, add the
following preamble:

   #!/usr/bin/python
   import exec_anaconda
   exec_anaconda.exec_anaconda()
   # Put the rest of your imports below, e.g.:
   import numpy as np
